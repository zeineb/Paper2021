\section{Introduction}
Secure software can be obtained out of two distinct processes:
Security by Design, and Security by Certification.
The former approach has been quite extensively formalized as it builds upon models,, which are verified to ensure security properties are attained fromand from which software is then derived manually or automatically. In contrast, the latter approach has been quite always informal in both specifying security best practices ans verifying that the code produced conforms to them.TO THEM.
